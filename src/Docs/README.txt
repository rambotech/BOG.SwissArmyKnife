This is a collection of utility classes I have made over the years to handle 
various tasks which weren't native to the Microsoft assemblies.

1.4.0 -- 12/20/2018
- Adds new StringEx method ContainsWildcardPattern().  Supports * (multiple) and ? (single) wildcard in any position.  
  Set StringExTests.cs for examples.
